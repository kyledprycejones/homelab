# Orchestrator v7.2 (archived)

This doc previously documented an older Stage 1. The active pipeline now
relies on Ubuntu Server VMs running k3s, so consult `docs/master_memo.txt`,
`infrastructure/proxmox/README.md`, and the scripts under
`infrastructure/proxmox/` for any current work. Consider this file a historical
snapshot only.
