  description: 'Investigate and fix the Stage 1 prox-n100 bootstrap script based on
    recent executor failures (e.g., mkdir ''//.talos'' permission error). Ensure the
    Talos directory is created in a user-writable location (such as $HOME/.talos)
    and that the harness does not require root. Do not run heavy side-effects here;
    focus on code / path correctness and logging.
