id: task-002-create-demo-app
description: Add a small demo app (hello-world web service) to cluster/kubernetes/apps/ and expose it via ingress-nginx/Cloudflared with NFS-backed storage.
acceptance_criteria:
  - App manifest lives under cluster/kubernetes/apps/demo/ with Deployment, Service, and IngressRoute/Ingress
  - PVC uses nfs-storage StorageClass and binds successfully after Flux sync
  - Public hostname resolves through Cloudflared tunnel and returns 200 OK
persona_flow:
  - Planner: propose minimal app shape and routing hostnames; confirm storage needs
  - Engineer: write manifests and overlays; ensure values are GitOps-safe
  - Executor: apply via Flux (or wait for reconciliation) and validate reachability/logs
repo_paths:
  - cluster/kubernetes/apps/demo/
  - cluster/kubernetes/platform/ingress/ingress-nginx/
  - cluster/kubernetes/platform/ingress/cloudflared/
