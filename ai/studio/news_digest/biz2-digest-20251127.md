# Biz2 Daily Digest – 2025-11-27

Source notes:
- `memory/news/20251127-1200Z-homelab-ai-roundup.md`

Summary:
- Biz2 is positioned as a local-first AI R&D lab running on homelab hardware with Ollama models as the default engine.
- Existing scaffolding (agents, workflows, memory, reports) is ready to support daily digests and experiment recaps.

Next steps:
- Use this digest format as the baseline when capturing future news pulses.
- Open a corresponding recap based on `reports/research/digest_report_template.md` once an experiment-worthy opportunity appears.
