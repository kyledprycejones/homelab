# AI Studio Backlog

## Biz2 Scaffolding
- [x] Wire `ai/studio/main.py` with an argparse CLI that dispatches workflows.
- [x] Draft agent prompt kits (PM, Architect, Engineer, Researcher, Marketer) under `ai/studio/agents/`.
- [x] Add workflow stubs (daily_digest, prototype_loop) under `ai/studio/workflows/` referencing the Biz2 charter.
- [x] Create report + digest templates in `reports/` and `news_digest/`.
- [x] Document `memory/` data schema and retention expectations.

## Experiment Ideas
- [ ] Build a homelab status dashboard (services, storage, cluster health)
- [ ] Generate Minecraft mod config sets tailored to prox-n100
- [ ] Design a marketing landing page for funoffshore.com
- [ ] Prototype an AI-assisted troubleshooting agent for k3s/Flux logs
