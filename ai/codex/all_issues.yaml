    summary: "Validate Talos-only bootstrap; ensure 'talos' stage is clean on N100"
    details: |
      Focus is on running `./infrastructure/proxmox/cluster_bootstrap.sh talos` cleanly. Awaiting first run logs from N100 to trace the first real failure.

    summary: "setup_local_git_snapshot assumes SSH on Talos node; incompatible"
    details: |
      The function `setup_local_git_snapshot()` in cluster_bootstrap.sh SSHes to the controller IP to run a local git daemon. Talos nodes have no SSH. This is only invoked in the GitOps/apps phase, not in the `talos` stage, so it does not block bootstrap. Track for later: either disable on Talos or run snapshot on Proxmox host instead.

    summary: "Proxmox host 192.168.1.214 unreachable from CLI loop"
    details: |
      Running `./cli_loop.sh` hung while SSHing to 192.168.1.214, then the command timed out. Without network reachability to the N100 host, the Talos bootstrap cannot progress. Need the Proxmox host accessible from the Mac (or an updated reachable host/IP) before retrying.
      Latest check: `nc 192.168.1.214 22` returns "Operation not permitted" in the sandbox, so outbound connectivity appears blocked.
      Resolved: SSH to 192.168.1.214 now works from the Mac runner; new blocker is Proxmox VM disk creation failing in vms.sh.

    status: open
    summary: "Talos API unreachable on 192.168.1.151-153 after VM provision"
    details: |
      Updated cli_loop.sh now provisions Talos VMs on Proxmox with correct disk sizes and boot order (ide2 first) using qemu-img. cluster_bootstrap.sh waits for the Talos API before apply-config, but talosctl version/apply still cannot reach 192.168.1.151:50000 even after 600s. VMs are running on Proxmox (`qm config 101` shows scsi0 size=40G, boot order=ide2;scsi0), and ARP entries exist for 192.168.1.151-153, but ping/port checks fail from both the Mac and Proxmox host. Need console output on the Talos VMs to understand why the API never comes up (kernel panic, installer prompt, network issue, etc.).
