Run ID: 2025-12-03T19:19:57Z
Target: prox-n100
Stage: stage_1
Tasks attempted:
  - Cloudflared tunnel manifests (ConfigMap/Deployment kustomization)
Backlog items:
  - [running] S1-000-PROVISION: Provision Talos VMs on Proxmox before cluster bootstrap. VMs must boot from Talos ISO (not Ubuntu) so talosctl can connect to port 50000.
  - [blocked] S1-001-RUN: Run Stage 1 bootstrap for prox-n100; stop on first failure and log.
  - [completed] S1-001-RUN-ENG: Investigate and fix the Stage 1 prox-n100 bootstrap script based on recent executor failures (e.g., mkdir '//.talos' permission error). Ensure the Talos directory is created in a user-writable location (such as $HOME/.talos) and that the harness does not require root. Do not run heavy side-effects here; focus on code / path correctness and logging.
  - [failed] S1-001-RUN-ENG-REVIEW: Review engineer patch for S1-001-RUN-ENG before applying.
  - [completed] S1-001-RUN-ENG2: Root cause analysis: cluster_bootstrap.sh expects Talos API on port 50000, but VMs are running Ubuntu (from proxmox_bootstrap_nocluster.sh). Created talos_vm_provision.sh to provision proper Talos VMs that boot from Talos ISO. Executor should run this script on Proxmox host before cluster_bootstrap.sh.
Result: partial_success
What was done:
  - See logs for details.
Where it got stuck:
  - ERROR: Stage precheck failed at line 178 (exit=1). Check the harness log for details.
Suggested next step:
  - Check log and rerun.
