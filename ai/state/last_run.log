Backlog items:
  - [running] S1-001-RUN: Run Stage 1 bootstrap for prox-n100; stop on first failure and log.
  - [review] S1-001-RUN-ENG: Investigate and fix the Stage 1 prox-n100 bootstrap script based on recent executor failures (e.g., mkdir '//.talos' permission error). Ensure the Talos directory is created in a user-writable location (such as $HOME/.talos) and that the harness does not require root. Do not run heavy side-effects here; focus on code / path correctness and logging.
