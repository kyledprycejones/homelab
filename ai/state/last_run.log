=== Funoffshore Orchestrator Run ===
Cluster: prox-n100 | Stage: orchestrator | CWD: /Users/kyle/Documents/repos/homelab | Time: 2025-11-27T12:56:50Z

Persona: Junior | Task: Biz2 R&D pipeline | Iteration: 3 | Last exit reason: in_progress

Objective: Advance the Biz2 R&D pipeline by standing up at least one concrete manual news digest using the existing templates and memory schema, then reflect that progress in the Biz2 scaffolding checklist and orchestrator state.

Allowed paths for this run:
- ai/studio/**
- ai/backlog.md
- ai/state/status.json
- ai/state/last_run.log
- ai/state/human_approvals.md
- ui/logs/public

State + backlog review commands:
$ date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'
(Used to timestamp the orchestrator run header.)

$ cat ai/company.md
(Reviewed personas, escalation paths, red-line areas, and allowed SSH hosts.)

$ cat ai/backlog.md
(Confirmed global backlog: Immediate and Short-Term sections fully checked; under Future, the first unchecked item remains "Biz2 R&D pipeline".)

$ cat ai/state/status.json
(Previous state: persona=junior, task="Biz2 R&D pipeline", iteration=2, last_exit_reason="in_progress".)

$ cat ai/state/human_approvals.md
(Three pending approvals unchanged: Cloudflare tunnel, DNS record, node reboot.)

$ cat ai/state/last_run.log
(Reviewed prior Junior run that wired Biz2 workflows, templates, memory schema, and CLI logging; confirmed Biz2 scaffolding is in place but the pipeline is still marked in progress.)

Biz2 context review:
$ cat ai/studio/backlog.md
(Verified Biz2 Scaffolding section is fully [x]; Experiment Ideas remain [ ].)

$ sed -n '1,260p' ai/studio/projects/biz2/README.md
(Refreshed Biz2 charter, outcomes, guardrails, milestones, and dependencies; confirmed focus on local-first AI Studio under ai/studio/.)

$ sed -n '1,260p' ai/studio/projects/biz2/scaffolding_checklist.md
(Located remaining unchecked items: manual news digest capture, ai_studio.sh helper, logging guidelines, graduation gates.)

$ sed -n '1,260p' ai/studio/news_digest/daily_digest_template.md
(Reviewed the daily digest template, including slug format `biz2-digest-YYYYMMDD` and references to memory/news and reports/research.)

Implementation – first manual news digest:
$ apply_patch (add ai/studio/memory/news/20251127-1200Z-homelab-ai-roundup.md)
- Created a timestamped raw news note in memory/news with minimal YAML frontmatter and three bullets summarizing current Biz2/Homelab AI context.

$ apply_patch (add ai/studio/news_digest/biz2-digest-20251127.md)
- Instantiated the daily digest template into a concrete file named after the slug `biz2-digest-20251127`.
- Linked back to the raw memory/news file and captured a short summary plus next steps for future digests.

Checklist update:
$ apply_patch (update ai/studio/projects/biz2/scaffolding_checklist.md)
- Marked the Data + Memory item "Capture at least one manual news digest in news_digest/" as [x] now that a concrete digest file exists.

State updates:
$ date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
(Captured ISO8601 timestamp 2025-11-27T12:56:50Z for status.json.)

$ apply_patch (update ai/state/status.json)
- Set persona=junior, task="Biz2 R&D pipeline", iteration=3.
- Kept last_exit_reason="in_progress" since several Biz2 checklist items (ops tooling and graduation gates) remain open.
- Updated timestamp to 2025-11-27T12:56:50Z.

Git operations (sandboxed):
$ git status -sb
(Showed modified ai/state files and many tracked/untracked paths from prior work, including ai/studio/; repository is still dirty.)

$ git add -A
(Failed with `fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted` due to sandbox restrictions on .git writes.)

$ git commit -m "orchestrator: Junior Biz2 manual digest"
(Failed with the same index.lock permission error; no new commit created.)

$ git push
(Failed with `Could not resolve host: github.com`, expected under restricted networking and absent new commit.)

Net effect:
- Biz2 now has a concrete example of the news memory + digest flow: one raw note under memory/news and one corresponding digest under news_digest using the agreed naming convention.
- The Biz2 scaffolding checklist reflects this progress with the manual news digest item checked off, while other Biz2 R&D pipeline tasks remain open for future loops.
- Orchestrator state has been updated to iteration=3 with last_exit_reason="in_progress"; git commit/push remain blocked by sandbox restrictions.
