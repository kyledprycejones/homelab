# AI workflow artifacts
This directory hosts auxiliary documentation for the Stage 0 orchestrator.

- `executor_output_template.md` shows the structure the executor uses to capture logs and trusted outputs.
- `orchestrator_decision_flow.md` maps the Planner/Engineer escalation rounds.

Add more workflows here when new coordination steps appear, keeping the files under ai/ to preserve the separation between Stage 0 logic and the GitOps repo.
